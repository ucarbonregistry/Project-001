Agriwaste Biogas Project at APMC in Vadodara, Gujarat

The project Agriwaste Biogas Project at APMC in Vadodara, Gujarat is located in near Ajwa 
Rd, NH-8, Nehru Chacha Nagar, Sayaji Park Society, City Vadodara, State Gujarat, India.
The purpose of the project activity is the set up 3 (three) independent biogas plants (digesters) of 
85m3 capacity. In the absence of the project activity, biomass and other organic matter (including 
manure where applicable) would be left to decay within the project boundary and methane would be 
emitted to the atmosphere. The baseline emissions are the amount of methane emitted from the 
decay of the degradable organic carbon in the biomass and other organic matter. 
Further, by using the captured biogas for electricity generation for captive usage, the project activity 
avoids carbon emissions related to the the baseline scenario in which electricity would be imported 
from the local coal fired dominated grid.

AMS.I.C. Thermal energy production with or 
without electricity

UCR Protocol Standard Baseline 
AMS-III.AO Methane recovery through controlled 
anaerobic digestion 

Sectoral scopes SECTORAL SCOPE -

Sources) 
13 Waste handling and disposal

By using the biogas captured from the digesters the project activity generates power for captive use. 
The project activity is the controlled biological treatment of biomass or other organic matters 
through anaerobic digestion in closed reactors equipped with biogas recovery for electricity 
generation and a combustion/flaring system.
